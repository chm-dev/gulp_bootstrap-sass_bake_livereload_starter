# Gulp + Sass + LiveReload + Bootstrap

This is working empty template with gulp workflow that
serves static content in public/. It watches for changes in public directory
and  triggers live reload. If change is made to sass file it is compiled
to public/css/dist directory.

Templated is based on [gist by user theRemix](https://gist.github.com/theRemix/b9f10de0bead6a7eaf5a) but replaced Foundation with Bootstrap.
